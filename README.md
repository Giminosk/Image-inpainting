# Image Inpainting

The objective of the image inpainting problem in the field of computer vision is to seamlessly integrate plausible content into missing or corrupted regions of an image. 

This technique has a wide range of applications, including the restoration of damaged photographs and the elimination of unwanted objects from an image.

This work endeavors to address this problem by successfully completing the inpainting process for a dataset of 10,000 images from [CelebA Dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/celeba)
